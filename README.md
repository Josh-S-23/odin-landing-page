# odin-landing-page

This project is based on The Odin Project Foundations: Landing Page project. The goal of this project was to replicate a complete website and build it from scratch while
also allowing us to add to the design with our own creative approach. The languages used in this project include HTML and CSS. This project taught me to apply basic
principles of CSS and HTML and to play around with flexbox to get a better understanding of how it is used.
